# Kogge-Stone Adder (KSA) Overview
The Kogge-Stone Adder (KSA) is a parallel-prefix adder known for its high-speed performance and efficient carry propagation. It is widely used in high-performance computing, digital signal processing (DSP), and processor ALUs due to its logarithmic time complexity 
ùëÇ(log2ùëõ), making it much faster than conventional ripple-carry adders.

# General Architecture
The Kogge-Stone Adder consists of three major steps:

* Preprocessing Stage

Compute the Generate (G) and Propagate (P) signals for each bit of the operands.

    Gi = Ai ‚ãÖ Bi 
    Pi = Ai ‚äï Bi 

* Carry signals Computation:

      Gi:j = Gi:k + Pi:k ‚ãÖ Gk-1:j 
      Pi:j  = Pi:k ‚ãÖ Pk-1:j

    Irrespective of the previous carry, the generation and propagation bits are being computed.

* Sum Evaluation: As all the carry bits are ready in advance, all the sum bits are evaluated in parallel.
